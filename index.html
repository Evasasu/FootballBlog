    Football, which is also known as soccer in many parts of the world, was invented over a century ago. Before today’s popularly known modern football, this game was played and was famous among the mid-19th century people.

    Though football is such a popular game, many football lovers do not know that there exists a national football team of India that participates in many international football events and is a part of the SAFF. It has also won several South Asian Football Federation or SAFF Championship.

    It is not as famous as other football teams. It has never taken part in the world’s most popular football tournaments like FIFA or Federation Internationale de Football Association World Cup.

    The national football team of India had performed well under the supervision and coaching of Syed Abdul Rahim in the 1950s and the 1960s. The team also got selected for the 1950s Federation Internationale de Football Association or FIFA World Cup, but it had withdrawn before the commencement of the game.

    The football lovers of India are eagerly waiting for the national team of India to take part in the FIFA World Cup and portray its skills to give a tough competition to the other teams
